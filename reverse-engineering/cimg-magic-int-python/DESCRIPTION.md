The most expedient way for computers to verify a magic number is by treating it as, well, a number.
That's what this challenge's `/challenge/cimg` does, to show you how these things are typically done in practice.
Here, we have a different magic number (otherwise there'd be no need to reverse the binary!) from the previous challenge.
Reverse the binary, keep endianness in mind, and pass the magic number check for the flag.
