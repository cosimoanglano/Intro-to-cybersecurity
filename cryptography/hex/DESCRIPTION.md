Reasoning about binary data (base 2) using decimal (base 10) numbers is confusing, because decimal does not have clean _bit boundaries_.
That is, a single decimal digit can represent 10 values (from `0` to `9`).
A single binary digit (bit) can represent two values (`0` and `1`), two bits can represent four values (`00`, `01`, `10`, and `11`), three bits can represent eight values (`000`, `001`, `010`, `011`, `100`, `101`, `110`, `111`), and four bits can represent sixteen values.
Ten values are represented by roughly `log2(10) == 3.3219...` bits, and you get weird situations like binary `1001` being decimal `9`, but binary `1100` (still 4 binary digits) being `12` (_two_ decimal digits!).
This variability makes it hard to spot-translate numbers between decimal and binary in general: we can work out that `97` is `110001`, but it's hard to see that at a glance.

It's much easier to spot-translate between bases that have more alignment between digits.
For example, a single hexadecimal (base 16) digit can represent 16 values (`0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `e`, `f`): the same number of values that binary can represent in 4 digits!
This allows us to have a super simple mapping:

| Hex | Binary | Decimal |
|-----|--------|---------|
| `0` | `0000` | `0`     |
| `1` | `0001` | `1`     |
| `2` | `0010` | `2`     |
| `3` | `0011` | `3`     |
| `4` | `0100` | `4`     |
| `5` | `0101` | `5`     |
| `6` | `0110` | `6`     |
| `7` | `0111` | `7`     |
| `8` | `1000` | `8`     |
| `9` | `1001` | `9`     |
| `a` | `1010` | `10`    |
| `b` | `1011` | `11`    |
| `c` | `1100` | `12`    |
| `d` | `1101` | `13`    |
| `e` | `1110` | `14`    |
| `f` | `1111` | `15`    |

This mapping from a hex digit to 4 bits is something that's easily memorizable (most important: memorize `1`, `2`, `4`, and `8`, and you can quickly derive the rest).
Better yet, two hex digits is **8** bits, which is one byte!
Unlike decimal, where you'd have to memorize 16 mappings for 4 bits and 256 mappings for 8 bits, with hexadecimal, you only have to memorize 16 mappings for 4 bits and the same amount of mappings for 8 bits, since it's just two hexadecimal digits concatenated!
Some examples:

| Hex  | Binary      | Decimal |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `00` | `0000 0000` | `0`     |
| `0e` | `0000 1110` | `14`    |
| `3e` | `0011 1110` | `62`    |
| `e3` | `1110 0011` | `227`   |
| `ee` | `1110 1110` | `238`   |

Now you're starting to see the beauty.
This gets even more obvious when you expand beyond one byte of input, but we'll let you find that out through future challenges!

Now, let's talk about notation.
How do you differentiate `11` in decimal, `11` in binary (which equals `3` in decimal), and 11 in hex (which equals `17` in decimal)?
Python's notation is to prepend binary data with `0b`, hexadecimal with `0x`, and keep decimal as is, resulting in `11 == 0b1011 == 0xb`, `3 == 0b11 == 0x3`, and `17 == 0b10001 == 0x11`.

Some other Pythonisms that might be useful:

- If you `print(n)` a number or convert it to a string with `str(n)`, the number will be represented in base 10.
- You can get a hexadecimal string representation of a number using `hex(n)`.
- You can get a binary string representation of a number using `bin(n)`.
- Converting a string to a number with `int(s)` will read it as a base 10 number by default.
- You can specify a different base to use with a second argument: `int(s, 16)` will interpret the string as hex, `int(s, 2)` will interpret it as binary.
- You can try to auto-identify the number base using `int(s, 0)`, which requires a prefex on the string (`0b` or binary, `0x` for hex, nothing for decimal).

Armed with this knowledge, go and hex the challenge and get the flag!
